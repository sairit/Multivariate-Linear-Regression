# Linear Regression Implementation from Scratch

**Author:** Sai Yadavalli  
**Version:** 1.0

A clean and efficient implementation of multiple linear regression using the normal equation method, built from scratch with NumPy and featuring comprehensive visualization capabilities.

## Overview

This project implements multiple linear regression without using scikit-learn or other machine learning libraries, demonstrating a solid understanding of linear algebra fundamentals and statistical modeling principles. The implementation provides an exact analytical solution using matrix operations and includes interactive data loading and visualization features.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Linear Regression Model
The implementation is based on the linear hypothesis function:

```
h(x) = w₀ + w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ = X·W
```

Where:
- `W = [w₀, w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ]ᵀ` is the weight vector
- `X` is the feature matrix with bias term
- `w₀` is the intercept (bias term)

### Normal Equation Solution
The implementation uses the closed-form analytical solution:

```
W = (XᵀX)⁻¹XᵀY
```

This method provides the optimal weights that minimize the mean squared error without requiring iterative optimization.

### Cost Function
The model minimizes the mean squared error (MSE):

```
J(W) = (1/m) * ||XW - Y||²
```

Where:
- `m` is the number of training examples
- `||·||²` represents the squared Euclidean norm
- The cost measures the average squared difference between predictions and actual values

train_features = data.columns.drop(y_feature)

# Create matrices and solve
X, Y = matrix_maker(train_features, y_feature, m, data)
cost, weights = calculate_cost(X, Y, m)
